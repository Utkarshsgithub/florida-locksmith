                <h1>Safe Locksmith in Florida</h1>
                <p>As safes have become more popular, the need for safe locksmith services has skyrocketed. If you have
                    a safe, whether it's a modest home safe, a jewelry safe, a wall safe, a floor safe, or any other
                    sort of safe, you're at risk of being locked out and unable to access vital documents or expensive
                    goods. You might be tempted to try to open the safe by breaking the lock, but this will severely
                    damage it and render it worthless. Call Floridian instead of making that mistake. Our skilled safe
                    locksmiths have the gear necessary to open your safe securely and we are always ready to provide
                    safe locksmith services in Fort Lauderdale, Fl.</p>
                <h2>We have various ways to help you open your safe</h2>
                <p>Floridian Locksmiths can assist you with any form of safe locksmith service in Fort Lauderdale, FL.
                    In addition to our other services, we can assist with combo changes, bolt downs, and safe
                    combinations. We work on Liberty safes, Sentry safes, Amsec safes, Champion safes, Hollow safes, and
                    safe boxes built in the United States.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Drilling the safe</strong>
                    <br>
                    Drilling the safe may be faster than manipulating it, but it does result in slight cosmetic damage.
                    The safe is drilled with a small hole. The type of safe and how the safe lock is attached determine
                    where the hole is bored. A scoping tool is sent through the hole and through the hard plate and into
                    the lock to allow the locksmith to examine how the safe unlocks. Drilling has become more difficult
                    since security features make bypassing a safe's lock more difficult.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Scoping the safe</strong>
                    <br>
                    Scoping the safe is similar to drilling, only a borescope is put into the drilled hole to view the
                    safe's interior components. This procedure is utilized when the locksmith has to get beyond
                    additional security measures.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Safe manipulation</strong>
                    <br>
                    When it comes to unlocking a safe, locksmiths prefer to manipulate the safe. This is because this
                    procedure will not harm your safe or its contents. While attempting to operate the safe, our
                    locksmiths will carefully listen to it. They adjust the dial and its wheels until everything is in
                    place. They know the unlocking process is beginning when they hear the sound created when the driver
                    pins contact the notch on the flywheel.
